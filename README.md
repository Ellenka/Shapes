# Shapes
This is a first, raw verstion.
Needs to be corrected:

Design
- add photos/draw shapes on each shape page (via css)
- buttons like shapes
- output results to dialog box, not console

Model
- check for double (user can input strings, chars, whatever)
- check whether all sides for triangle are input
- check whether triangle exists ( if (a1+b1 > c1 && a1+c1 > b1 && b1+c1 > a1))
- cast output numbers
- back button: code repeats, avoid
